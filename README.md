# PERFORM OPERATIONS ON MATRICES

Simple programs developed using C help you learn how to use array data structures (1D/2D).
Using double pointers essentially helps you stengthen your foundation in C programming as a beginner.
Trust me, they are fun!

Here, check if a matrix is a diagonal/square/traingular/identity/symmetric matrix or not,
find the determinant/diagonal/spiral/transpose of any matrix,
print the column-major representation of any matrix.

## Commands

Learning to use the terminal/command prompt to run programs could possibly be the best thing you can ever do to yourself!
For terminal users,
1. Navigate to your directory
2. ``` gcc filename.c ```
3. ``` ./a.out ```

Tadaa! Here you go!
